# go-info

get system info with static go binary


The idea here was to gradually add system diagnostic information that is commonly available in the golang standard library.
Such a tool could be usable in situations where you may not have standard unit tools available, such as a scratch container.

The only thing ive implemented so far is uname, mostly out of curiosity.
